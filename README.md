# Local Storage Demo

## Purpose

This repo is from an in-class live coding demonstration from 1/28’s Code:You’s Web Development class. We talked about and worked through some small examples focusing on local storage.

I have cleaned up the code and made comments on what we talked about in order for other class nights to review and experiment with it. If you have not completed the JSON and Data Persistence lessons or were not present for the demo, please complete those lessons before working with this code.

## How to Use

The code is divided into four parts. Please make sure to uncomment the JavaScript file that you are working with, and comment out the others inside `index.html`

```html
<!-- To use the associated JS files for each part, comment out all but the script that you intend to use -->

<script src="./js/partOne.js"></script>
<!-- <script src="./js/partTwo.js"></script> -->
<!-- <script src="./js/partThree.js"></script> -->
<!-- <script src="./js/partFour.js"></script> -->
```

## Suggested Exploration

I recommend using this as another resource. Take what is covered in this demo and expand on it. I suggest doing the following:

- Implement a function simplifying removing items from local storage similar to the `saveToLocalStorage` and `addToLocalStorage` functions
- Change the data that is being used in the demo to make it more sensible to you
- Using the concepts, create a small form where the data is saved to local storage on submissions

There’s more that you can do, but those three stick out immediately to me.
